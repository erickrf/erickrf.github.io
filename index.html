            I am a postdoc researcher in Natural Language Processing at <a href="http://www.it.pt">Instituto de Telecomunicações</a>. I received my Master's degree and PhD from the University of São Paulo, at the <a href="http://www.icmc.usp.br/">Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science</a>. I was a member of <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/">NILC</a>.
            Between April 2016 and April 2017, I was an intern in the <a href="http://hlt-nlp.fbk.eu/">NLP group of Fondazione Bruno Kessler</a>.
           </p>
           <p>
            My research is centered in Natural Language Processing, a field that I greatly enjoy. I currently work with structured learning (i.e., models that learn complex structures) under a deep learning framework.

	     My best known project is <a href="https://github.com/erickrf/nlpnet">nlpnet</a>. It is a Python library (together with standalone scripts) for training and running NLP tagging tools based on neural networks and distributed word representations, also known as word embeddings. Documentation can be found <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/nlpnet/">here</a>, along with pre-trained models.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	     Currently, my version performs POS tagging and SRL, and I plan to add NER identification (at least one fork implemented it) and parsing in the coming months.

	   In 2016, I released <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/assin/">ASSIN</a>, a corpus for Recognizing Textual Entailment (or Natural Language Inference) and Semantic Textual Similarity in Portuguese.
	   A good number of colleagues and professores helped in many ways ASSIN to get ready. It was used in a <a href="http://propor2016.di.fc.ul.pt/?page_id=381">shared task</a> parallel to the PROPOR 2016 conference.

      	   In 2013 and 2014, I revised the <a href="http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/macmorpho/">Mac-Morpho</a> corpus, a collection of newswire texts in Brazilian Portuguese manually annotated with POS tags. Duplicated sentences and sentences with missing words were removed, and a few other corrections were performed. Word contractions were joined in a single token, as they appear in actual text, instead of leaving them separated. Both the original and the revised versions can be found in the link.
